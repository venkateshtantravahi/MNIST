# MNIST
Hand Written Digit Recognition 

# Some Intro
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

# About MNIST Data 
The MNIST database, an extension of the NIST database, is a low-complexity data collection of handwritten digits used to train and test various supervised machine learning algorithms. The database contains 70,000 28x28 black and white images representing the digits zero through nine.

This repo mainly concentrate on how to load data from the keras inbuilt datasets and prepare the data for fitting into the model
The model used here is a basic dense network formed through keras and tensorflow library
